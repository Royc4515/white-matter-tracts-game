# White Matter Tracts – Interactive Drag & Drop Game

An interactive, browser-based learning game for practicing **white matter tract classification**
(**Commissural vs Association fibers**) using drag-and-drop.

Built for **neuroscience / neuroanatomy courses**, lectures, and self-practice.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objective

Students practice distinguishing between:
- **Commissural fibers** – connections *between hemispheres*
- **Association fibers** – connections *within the same hemisphere*

The game supports both **guided learning** and **exam-style testing**.

  - Answers are auto-checked
  - Score is displayed
  - Board is locked
