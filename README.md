# White Matter Tracts Game

An interactive, browser-based drag-and-drop game for learning and testing
**white matter tract classification** in neuroanatomy.

The game focuses on distinguishing between:
- **Commissural fibers** – connections *between hemispheres*
- **Association fibers** – connections *within the same hemisphere*

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Reinforce conceptual understanding of white matter organization
- Practice correct classification of major tracts
- Support both **guided learning** and **exam-style testing**

---

## 🕹️ Game Modes

### ⚡ Training Mode (Practice)
- Immediate feedback on every drag
- Incorrect drops snap back automatically
- Score counts **correct / total attempts**
- Full tract names appear after correct placement
- Success message when all 10 items are placed correctly

Best suited for **learning, demonstrations, and practice**.

---

### 🧪 Test Mode (Assessment)
- No feedback while dragging
- Student must either:
  - Click **Check Answers**, or
  - Let the **timer expire**
- Timer options: **30 / 60 / 90 seconds**
- Timer starts **only on the first drag**
- When time is up:
  - All placed answers are **auto-checked**
  - Score shown as **Correct X / 10**
  - Board is **locked** until Reset
- After manual checking, the board is also locked (exam-style)

Best suited for **quizzes and assessment**.

---

## ⏱️ Time Control (Test Mode)
- Click the timer button to cycle between **30s / 60s / 90s**
- Changing the time **resets all placements**
- Timer does not start until the first drag

## 🧠 Content Covered (Instructor Reference)

### Commissural
- Between hemispheres
- CC – corpus callosum
- AC – anterior commissure
- PC – posterior commissure

### Association
- Within the same hemisphere
- SLF – superior longitudinal fasciculus
- ILF – inferior longitudinal fasciculus
- IFOF – inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus
- UNC – uncinate fasciculus
- Fornix

Classification follows the instructor’s reference table.
